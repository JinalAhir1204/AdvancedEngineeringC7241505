Assessment of AE

DETAILS OF THE ASSESSMENT 

Graphical Programming Language Application
This assignment is to use what you are learning in the module to produce a fairly complex 
program. The idea of the program is to produce a simplified environment for teaching simple 
programming concepts. You are to create a simple programming language and environment 
that has the basics of sequence, selection and iteration and allows a student programmer to 
explore them using graphics. 
Note that the assignment has two components. They are marked separately. If you fail 
either part and your overall module mark is below 40% you are likely to get reassessment in 
those part/s that you failed. You should read both parts of the assignment to see where you 
are aiming. You could tackle them completely separately, i.e. worry about part two when it 
arrives and therefore treat part one as a prototype, but this will involve reworking part one 
for part two. For example to put design patterns into it which isnâ€™t on the marking scheme 
for part one. Or you could design part 2 elements in from scratch. Both methods are valid 
software engineering methods. I would at the very least be very familiar with part two 
whilst you are doing part one so that you can make an informed choice at the time.
